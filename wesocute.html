<h1>We Are SO Cute Together! </h1>
<a> I mean... can you think of a cuter couple than two computer scientists who met in highschool and fell in love with eachother, AND then decided to go to the same college?
  It doesnt get much cuter than that, right?</a><br>
  <img src="love.png" style="width:66.6%"><br>
  <a> Remember this? The most fun stuff from our first year anniversary! <br>
  But think about all the fun stuff we've done since then! Kayaking, going to more restaurants, going hiking, flying kites,
getting a tattoo (and seeing someone get a tattoo!), so so so much cooking, and all kinds of stuff! <br>
I mean, can you really think of a couple better than us?</a>
